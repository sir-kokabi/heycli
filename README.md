# HeyCLI ü§ñ - Your AI Buddy for Daily Tasks

Stop wasting time on repetitive chores! `heycli` is your AI-powered command-line assistant that instantly automates everyday tasks. Forget writing scripts ‚Äì simply run commands like `heycli remove all empty folders`. Zero setup, maximum efficiency.

For example, need to convert all your `.png` images to `.jpg`? Just type `heycli convert *.png to *.jpg`. Or, if you want to extract the first column of your `contacts.csv` and save it to `names.txt`, simply use `heycli extract column 1 from contacts.csv to names.txt`.

**heycli** shows the code and confirms execution before running, ensuring you're always in control.

Also, by default, it works in your current directory, so you don't have to specify the current working directory every time in your prompt.

**If you can describe it, HeyCLI can do it.**
Get your time back.
